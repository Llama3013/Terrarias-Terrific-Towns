# Terraria's Terrific Towns

To access the current published website: https://llama3013.github.io/Terrarias-Terrific-Towns/

## About

This website is made to help users plan/organize their terraria worlds to have the npc happiness the way they want them. It displays a town (a town is a collection of npc houses within 25 blocks of the other houses) and all their npcs in the town. It shows the happiness of each npc depending on their likes/dislikes of npcs, likes/dislikes of their current biomes, overcrowding or sparse area. It also can track pylons. ~~There may be some happiness calculation issues at the moment since there was an update (1.4.1) that changed some things about npc happiness and implemented the princess npc and I haven't found out how these new changes work.~~ The issues with happiness calculations should be fixed now and updated to the newest update (1.4.2).

## Import/export

You can import/export your towns by uploading/downloading (or just copy/paste) the towns data using the top left menu

## Extra features

You can access some extra features by using the top left menu. These consist of the "multi biome" setting which allows you to change the current biome for specfic npcs, the "notes" setting alllows you to add notes at the end of every town and the "assume solitary" setting which assumes every town is outside of 120 tiles from each other town (this starts turned on). Settings are included in import/export so if notes are included in a town and the note setting is on you can export the notes for others.

## Issues

Feel free to add any issues for coding problems, styling problems or general suggestions.
