# Terraria's Terrific Towns

To access the current published website: https://llama3013.github.io/Terrarias-Terrific-Towns/

## About

This website is made to help users plan/organize their terraria worlds to have the npc happiness the way they want them. It displays a town (a town is a collection of npc houses within 25 blocks of the other houses) and all their npcs in the town. It shows the happiness of each npc depending on their likes/dislikes of npcs, likes/dislikes of their current biomes, overcrowding or sparse area. It also can track pylons. ~~There may be some happiness calculation issues at the moment since there was an update (1.4.1) that changed some things about npc happiness and implemented the princess npc and I haven't found out how these new changes work.~~ The issues with happiness calculations should be fixed now and updated to the newest update (1.4.2).

## Issues
